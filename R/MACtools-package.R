#' Tools to Work with Media Access Control ('MAC') Addresses
#'
#' A media access control address (MAC address) of a device is a unique
#' identifier assigned to a network interface controller (NIC) for
#' communications at the data link layer of a network segment. MAC addresses are
#' used as a network address for most IEEE 802 network technologies, including
#' Ethernet and Wi-Fi. In this context, MAC addresses are used in the medium
#' access control protocol sublayer. Tools are provided to work with these 'MAC' addresses.
